## UserVoice iOS SDK example using Swift

This is an example of using the [UserVoice iOS SDK](https://github.com/uservoice/uservoice-ios-sdk) project with Swift.

To duplicate this in your project:

1. Add `pod 'uservoice-iphone-sdk', '~> 3.2'` to your [Podfile](https://github.com/uservoice/uservoice-ios-sdk-example-swift/blob/master/Podfile)
2. `pod install`
3. Add `#import "UserVoice.h"` to your [bridging header](https://github.com/uservoice/uservoice-ios-sdk-example-swift/blob/master/SDK%20Demo/UserVoice-Bridging-Header.h)
4. Configure and launch the SDK, as demonstrated in [ViewController.swift](https://github.com/uservoice/uservoice-ios-sdk-example-swift/blob/master/SDK%20Demo/ViewController.swift)

See the [UserVoice iOS SDK](https://github.com/uservoice/uservoice-ios-sdk) README for details about configuration options.
